# A-Pathfinding-Algorithm-for-Maze-Solving
This Python script implements the A* pathfinding algorithm using the Turtle graphics library to visually solve a maze. The program sets up a maze defined by a grid and animates the search process, demonstrating how the A* algorithm finds the shortest path from a starting point to an endpoint.
